Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels.  Cardio vascular disease accounts for the majority of death all over the world. This makes CVD detection an important task in health care industry.
The aim of this project is to build an efficient and accurate machine learning model that can classify the patients to be healthy or suffering from cardiovascular disease based on the available attributes in the dataset. The publically available cardio vascular disease dataset from Kaggle is used in this study. The task is to classify a person to healthy or suffering from heart disease based on the given data. We have used data science techniques and visualization for this study.
Comapred to other algorithms,we have obtained a maximum accuracy of 74 % when gradient boosting is used.
